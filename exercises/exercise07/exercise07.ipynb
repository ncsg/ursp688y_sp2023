    "- Choose a straightforward question that requires a reasonable amount of data! Don't shoot for the moon. This exercise is intended to give you a chance to practice finding and analyzing spatial data, not to address the world's greatest challenges.\n",
    "- Consider using this exercise to get a head start on your final project or explore options for it. Your project doesn't need to focus on spatial analysis for it to play a role. Are there datasets you might join together based on spatial locations?\n",
    "- Don't go overboard. If you're hitting a wall with coding, write pseudocode and turn that in. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the done. But if you're energized and having fun by chasing down a thorny solution to a coding problem, by all means feel free to keep at it!\n",
